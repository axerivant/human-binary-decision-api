## summary

While watching an episode of the sci-fi tv series 'Westworld', one particular line caught my attention.

> A human is just an algorthm of less than 12000 lines.

Now, I won't try to implement that. Not yet at least. But instead I thought it will be interesting to try to implement a drastic simplification of this. A simple (not so simple) API that will make a yes or no decision based on a customizeable human instance, *based on actual psychological principles*.

## personal motivations

* I have been looking into learning a backend language, and this might be just the right project to get started. 
* This project will also likely motivate me further because it operates in the realm of several of my major life interests: psychology, philosophy, and of course, coding itself. 

## timeline

I'm not getting started on this right now, but probably soon.
